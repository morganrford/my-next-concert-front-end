# Stretch goals

* The user would be able to click on the venue and see more information about it such as Google Maps for directions, parking information, will call, etc.
* The user would be able to view a page with more information about a band, and be able to listen to some of their songs within the page.
* The details for the show would be directly on the concert poster, and users would be able to interact with the poster itself.
* Users would be able to browse concerts and filter them by location, genre, etc.
* Users would be able to use a search bar to look for certain concerts or bands.
* Users would be able to save concerts they want to go to, and view it in a list. 
* The user would be able to change their username and password.
* Users would be able to view a page for a certain promoter and see all of their shows listed on that page.
* Users would be able to upload their show poster directly to the website instead of through a third party.
